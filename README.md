# Cubeo - A Level based unity game

![image](https://i.imgur.com/g5A2ltM.png)

### This game is based of Brackey's game tutorial | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j48LtUkZRjU&list=PLPV2KyIb3jR53Jce9hP7G5xC4O9AgnOuL
### Turned into a project of mine adding new levels and features every week
### Everything here is open-source for anyone to use and change. I do recommend watching Brackey's Video rather than taking code straight from here (Learn something new ;D)


##### I have decided to rewrite the game due to the mess of the code I made | First Release in the works
